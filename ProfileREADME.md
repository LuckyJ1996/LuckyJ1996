- Hello everyone. I am Lucky Jones. I am a new python developer looking to earn their stripes by volunteering on open source projects.
I've already created a few projects on my own for my current employer. Mainly working with openpyxl, pandas, beautifulsoup, and tkinter.
I love databases, spreadsheets, web scraping, and python. I'm looking to learn more about SQL, and Java eventually.
Feel free to DM me if you want to work together on something.
